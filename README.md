* ISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 0134293932
* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0134293936
  * * Author: Nivaldo Tro
   
  * Tells the story of chemistry in a unified and thematic way while building 21st century skills
 
  * Bestselling author Nivaldo Tro’s premise is that matter is particulate - it is composed of molecules; the structure of those particles determines the properties of matter. ” This core idea is the inspiration for his seminal text―Chemistry: Structure and Properties. Dr. Tro emphasizes the relationship between structure and properties, establishes a unique approach to teaching chemistry by presenting atomic and bonding theories early in the course, and stresses key concepts and themes in text, images, and interactive media. The book is organized to present chemistry as a logical, cohesive story from the microscopic to the macroscopic, so students can fully grasp the theories and framework behind the chemical facts. Each topic is carefully crafted to convey to students that the relationship between structure and properties is the thread that weaves all of chemistry together.
 
The 2nd Edition works seamlessly with Mastering™ Chemistry and new eText 2.0 to engage students in active learning and the world of chemistry. Dr. Tro helps readers build 21st century skills, engaging them through new end-of-chapter questions―Data Interpretation and Analysis questions present real data in real life situations and ask students to analyze that data, and Questions for Group Work foster collaborative learning and encourage students to work together as a team to solve problems. Dr. Tro also engages students through the power of video, animations, and real-time assessment with new and expanded interactive media. New Key Concept Videos, newly interactive Conceptual Connections and Self-Assessment Quizzes, and Interactive Worked Examples are embedded in the new eText 2.0 version of the book, enabling students to make connections that they cannot make by simply reading a static page.
